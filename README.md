# ☕ Coffee Machine Simulation (Python)

This is a **console-based Coffee Machine Simulation** built using Python. It simulates the behavior of a coffee machine that serves three drinks: **espresso, latte, and cappuccino**. Users can insert coins, and the machine will calculate if enough funds have been provided, process transactions, and report remaining resources.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts user input to select a drink (`espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`)
- Simulates coin insertion using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies
- Calculates total inserted amount and checks against drink cost
- Returns change if extra money is inserted
- Displays machine resource status via the `report` command
- Option to turn off the machine with the `off` command

---

## 📝 How It Works

- **Menu Options:**
  - `espresso` ($1.5)
  - `latte` ($2.5)
  - `cappuccino` ($3.0)
  
- **Special Commands:**
  - Type `report` to display current water, milk, coffee, and money
  - Type `off` to turn off the machine

- **Coin Inputs Supported:**
  - Quarters (`$0.25`)
  - Dimes (`$0.10`)
  - Nickels (`$0.05`)
  - Pennies (`$0.01`)

## 💪 Why I Built This

This project was part of my journey to improve my **Python programming skills** through hands-on projects. It demonstrates my ability to work with:
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Data organization using dictionaries
- Simulating real-world processes in code
